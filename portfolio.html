          <p>My home lab is one the projects that enjoy to work on outside of work. The current setup that I use is home server that I like to try out and practice with new 
            software or anything else that peaks my interest. An example of one of the projects I use my home lab for is running my own Minecraft server. One of the ways I went about 
            accomplishing this project was running the instance of Minecraft on a Docker image to keep it isolated and contained from other application and software.

      <p>Throughout college and even afterwards. I have enjoyed the process of taking an idea and breaking it down into smaller pieces which then come together as a whole at the 
        end of the project. GitHub is the home in which I keep the majority of my programs. There are many different types such as a Pythom and Bash program that takes the IP addresses from 
        a routers log file and displays them on a globe of where the connections came from. Another program I wrote using Java was a database type of program that ustilizes the
        Model, View, and Controller design pattern to manage the key functions of the program. Learning to program without writing code in the language of the internet
        would be hard. I am not the exception. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develope my own site which you're currently on.

      <p>One of the other areas that interest me is Cybersecurity. One of the ways I like to try and stay up to date with the world of Cybersecurity is by practicing and learning 
        about via Hack the Box. If you are not aware of what Hack the Box is, no worries! Hack the Box is website that is designed to help train and educate about the practices of 
        security. The way in which these concepts are taught is done via an active learning method where in a exercise you will engage with a virtual machine that is 
        setup to be a safe way to learn without the fear of causing damage to a real machaine on a private network which could get you in trouble if you're not supposed to be on
        that network. This website and method is one of my favorite ways to 
        practice cybersecurity. Cybersecurity Blogs are also a great way to stay situationaly aware of whats going on in the world of cybersecurity. Some blogs include Krebs on Security, 
        Schneier on Security, Hacker news, and CSO Online.
