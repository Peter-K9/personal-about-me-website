      <p>Photography is one of the hobbies that I have recently been interested in.
        I started out doing some simple film photography since I value the texture and colors that are unique to film and can only be obtained via the analog method.
        I have also been wanting to branch out into the digital side of capturing pictures since it offers greater capacity of photos than the film side. 
        My website here actually utilizes several of my own pictures such as the background as well as one of my dogs Abby. Which you can see to the right here.

        Ever since I was a kid and watched the movie "The Great Escape" which starred the King of Cool himself, Steve McQueen. 
        During the film, there is a scene where McQueen's character, Capt. Hilts, steals a BMW motorcycle and then proceeds to use to try and escape to Switzerland.
        That scene might be the earliest memory that sparked my fascination and intrigue into motortcycles, machines, and most things mechanical. </p>

      <p>
        Programming, practicing hobbies, and working professionally in the technology domain means that I familiar with troubleshooting. One method I use to troubleshoot problems 
        while also staying fit and healthy is lifting weights. Taking a break to exercise helps after working on a problem by letting my mind rest and focus on something else 
        before returning to the problem, usually feeling refreshed with new ideas and solutions. 
        Weightlifting is a sport that I started in college after playing baseball from the ages of 5 to 18. It's a sport that 
        has more nuance to it than what I originally thought. Weightlifting, much like programming, has room for growth and experimentation.
